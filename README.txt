This is my implementation of the multiThreaded Chat Client/Server in which multiple clients can communicate with the server.

Whenever a client connects, the server displays a message that a Client is connected and same goes for the disconnection.

Run the Server.java, Connections.java File first and after that Run Client.java creates as many clients and enter the messages for various clients. The server would then respond giving the required answer for each of the clients.
